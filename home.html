                <font color="red"> Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena
                    Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of
                    Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle
                    persecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of
                    a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake.Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children
                    with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding
                    schools and muggles. </font>

                    Hogwarts is a coeducational, secondary boarding school, taking children from ages eleven to
                    seventeen.Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated
                    in the seventh book. Rowling initially said there are about one thousand students at Hogwarts.She
                    later suggested around six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with
                    the small number of people in Harry's year. She further explained that this had resulted from her
                    creating only forty characters for Harry's year.

                <font color="blue">Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder:
                    Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the school
                    year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as
                    performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has
                    its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Each house also has its own
                    Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between
                    the houses.</font>
